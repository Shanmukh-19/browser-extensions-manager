## Overview
 
 This is a simple Extension Manager UI application that displays extensions as cards, each with a remove button and a toggle switch to activate or deactivate them.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
